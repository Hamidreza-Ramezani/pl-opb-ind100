A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for US adults in 2019 reported varying levels of support for a generic "National Health Plan" among different political affiliations. For Independents, it was found that approximately {{ params.vars.p_hat_percent }}% supported the plan.

There were various sample sizes for each group, but for this problem, we are focusing on the responses from the Independents.

	<markdown>If we wanted to estimate this number to within {{ params.vars.margin_of_error_percent }}% with {{ params.vars.confidence }}% confidence, what would be an appropriate sample size?

<pl-number-input answers-name="part1_ans" rtol = "0.01" weight = "1" allow-blank = "False" label = "$n =$" ></pl-number-input>

<pl-answer-panel>because a sample proportion $(\hat{p} = {{ params.vars.p_hat }})$ is available, we use this for the sample size calculations. The margin of error for a ${{ params.vars.confidence }}$% confidence interval is ${{ params.vars.z_score }} \times SE = {{ params.vars.z_score }} \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$. We want this to be less than $0.01$, where we use $\hat{p}$ in place of $p:$

${{ params.vars.z_score }} \times \sqrt{\frac{ {{ params.vars.p_hat }} \times (1 - {{ params.vars.p_hat }} )}{n}} \leq 0.01$.

${{ params.vars.z_score }}^2 \times \sqrt{\frac{ {{ params.vars.p_hat }} \times (1 - {{ params.vars.p_hat }} )}{0.01^2}} \leq n$.

From this, we get that $n$ must be at least ${{ params.vars.n }}$.
